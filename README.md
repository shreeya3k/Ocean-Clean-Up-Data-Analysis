# Ocean-Clean-Up-Data-Analysis
Data analysis project for Booz Allen Hamilton on a dataset for ocean clean up 
The purpose of this project is to figure out, based on actual data, how we can optimize our ocean cleanup efforts. Booz Allen Hamilton wants to know the volume of resources needed to clean up the ocean, as well as which areas need the most amount of help. We will be working to provide a concrete path to present to our sponsor, highlighting the best ways for them to move forward.
